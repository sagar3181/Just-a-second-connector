**Just a Second Connector Workflow**
We have created a Worflow execution diagram for our "Just A Second" connector. This workflow is designed to demonstrate the functionality of the total project we will be working further on.

**Super Admin Login page**
I have created a Super admin login page. It consists of username and password. i.e ., username:admin & password: admin-password so if we give the credentials and click on login it will navigate to admin dashboard.
Along wit that I have included the forget button, where if the admin forget his/her password if clicked on the button it will display aler message with entering Email id and then if clicked on OK button,it will display as  the mail sent to Admin to reset the password.
Followed by that if the username and password are correct then it will navigate to the admin dashboard where it contains Welcome message followed by "Matching jobseeker with Coach button".If clicked on it ,it will take to other dashboar that contains jobseeker and coach names.
