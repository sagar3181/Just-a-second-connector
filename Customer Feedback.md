**Information Radiator for Customer feedback and satisfaction ratings**

Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Data Source**:
   - Customer feedback and satisfaction ratings can be gathered through surveys sent to both job seekers and employers who have used the TWA platform.
   - Feedback can also be collected through direct interactions with users, such as follow-up emails or interviews.

2. **Visualization**:
   - A line graph or bar chart can be used to display overall satisfaction ratings over time.
   - Individual feedback comments or testimonials can be displayed alongside the ratings for added context.

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - The information radiator should update in real-time or at regular intervals to reflect the latest feedback data.
   - Backend functionality should be implemented to automatically update the feedback data whenever new responses are submitted.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - The information radiator should be easily accessible to TWA team members, particularly administrators and decision-makers.
   - It can be integrated into the admin dashboard that the front-end team is working on, providing a comprehensive view of program performance.

5. **Interactivity (Optional)**:
   - Users may benefit from interactive features such as filtering feedback by date range, user type (job seekers or employers), or specific program components.

6. **Privacy and Security**:
   - Ensure that any personally identifiable information collected through feedback forms is handled securely and in compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

7. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Encourage TWA team members to actively engage with the information radiator, using it to inform program improvements and decision-making.
   - Provide a mechanism for users to submit additional feedback or suggestions directly through the platform.

   Here's an example of how a bar chart could represent customer feedback for the "Just a Second Connector" project:
  
  Customer Feedback Satisfaction Ratings

| Rating | Number of Responses |
|--------|---------------------|
|   ★★★★ |          15         |
|   ★★★☆ |          10         |
|   ★★☆☆ |           5         |
|   ★☆☆☆ |           2         |

In this example:
★★★★ represents excellent satisfaction ratings.
★★★☆ represents good satisfaction ratings.
★★☆☆ represents average satisfaction ratings.
★☆☆☆ represents poor satisfaction ratings.
The number of responses for each rating category is displayed in the bar chart, providing a visual representation of the distribution of customer feedback satisfaction ratings. We can adjust the ratings categories and the number of responses based on the actual feedback data collected for the project.
