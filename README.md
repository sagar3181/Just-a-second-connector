# Just-a-second-connector
This is just a sample Jsc description.
Project description:
 TWA connects people who are involved with the Criminal Justice system in some way who need to find a job connect with employment opportunities at employers who are willing to give them a second chance. They currently track both sets of participants in their programs, the jobseekers and the employers, through a set of Google Docs. They need a system to help match the restrictions both groups require.
