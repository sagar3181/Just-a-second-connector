MongoDB Realm triggers for implementing email functionality triggered by database events in the "Just a Second Connector" project. This integration enhances the automation and efficiency of your application workflow, providing timely notifications for key actions.

**Accessing MongoDB Realm Dashboard:**
Open a web browser and navigate to MongoDB Realm.
Log in with your credentials.

Selecting Application:
Choose the "Just a Second Connector" application from the dashboard.

Navigating to Triggers:
In the left sidebar, click on "Triggers".
Creating a New Trigger:
Click on the "New Trigger" button.

Configuring Trigger:
Choose the appropriate trigger type (e.g., Database Trigger).
Specify the trigger conditions, including the database, collection, and event type related to employer registration, job seeker referral, or admin actions.
Save the trigger configuration.

Creating Email Sending Function:
Navigate to the "Functions" section.
Create a new function or select an existing one.
Implement the logic for sending emails within the function, such as notifications for successful employer registration, job seeker referrals, or admin login attempts.

Example Function Code (Node.js):
javascript code
exports = async function sendEmail(payload) {
const { recipientEmail, subject, body } = payload;

const emailService = context.services.get("emailService");
const senderEmail = "example@example.com"; // Your sender email address
try {
await emailService.send({
to: recipientEmail,
from: senderEmail,
subject: subject,
body: body
});
return { success: true, message: "Email sent successfully!" };
} catch (error) {
return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
};

Integrating Trigger with Function:
Return to the trigger configuration.
Specify the function to be executed when the trigger is activated.
Save the trigger configuration.

Example Trigger Configuration (JSON):
jsonCopy code
{
"name": "sendEmailTrigger",
"type": "DATABASE",
"databaseId": "<your-database-id>",
"options": {
"operationType": "INSERT", // Specify the relevant operation type
"target": "<your-collection>",
"fullDocument": "updateLookup"
},
"functionName": "sendEmail"
}

Â replace <your-database-id> with your actual database ID and <your-collection> with the name of your collection.
